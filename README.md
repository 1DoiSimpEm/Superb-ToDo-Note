My very first time of developing an android app using Kotlin with Android Architecture Components. 
Using Live Data in combination with Couroutine scope to make sure that room database run smoothly in background.
```

## Technologies used
```
Very first time develop an app using Kotlin makes me feel really confused cuz there is too many things to learn. 
But I am still able to implement stuffs though I am not thoroughtly get it how it works.

### 3rd party libraries used

- [RecyclerViewSwipeDecorator](https://github.com/xabaras/RecyclerViewSwipeDecorator) : To implement swipe layout.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android): To implement animation view.
- [CompactCalendarView](https://github.com/SundeepK/CompactCalendarView): Android calendar is too complicated, rather using this.

_Superb ToDo is incompleted because of the performance I made with rubbish code architecture, the main purpose is to make me feel motivated as I have my own product. So in further future the performance of will be improved as long as I keep gaining knowledge._
